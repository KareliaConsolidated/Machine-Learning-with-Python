# Practicing regular expressions: re.split() and re.findall()
# Now you'll get a chance to write some regular expressions to match digits, strings and non-alphanumeric characters. Take a look at my_string first by printing it in the IPython Shell, to determine how you might best match the different steps.
# Note: It's important to prefix your regex patterns with r to ensure that your patterns are interpreted in the way you want them to. Else, you may encounter problems to do with escape sequences in strings. For example, "\n" in Python is used to indicate a new line, but if you use the r prefix, it will be interpreted as the raw string "\n" - that is, the character "\" followed by the character "n" - and not as a new line.
# The regular expression module re has already been imported for you.
# Remember from the video that the syntax for the regex library is to always to pass the pattern first, and then the string second.
# Write a pattern to match sentence endings: sentence_endings
sentence_endings = r"[.?!]"

# Split my_string on sentence endings and print the result
print(re.split(sentence_endings, my_string))

# Find all capitalized words in my_string and print the result
capitalized_words = r"[A-Z]\w+"
print(re.findall(capitalized_words, my_string))

# Split my_string on spaces and print the result
spaces = r"\s+"
print(re.split(spaces, my_string))

# Find all digits in my_string and print the result
digits = r"\d+"
print(re.findall(digits, my_string))

# Introduction to tokenization
# Word tokenization with NLTK
# Here, you'll be using the first scene of Monty Python's Holy Grail, which has been pre-loaded as scene_one. Feel free to check it out in the IPython Shell!
# Your job in this exercise is to utilize word_tokenize and sent_tokenize from nltk.tokenize to tokenize both words and sentences from Python strings - in this case, the first scene of Monty Python's Holy Grail.
# Import necessary modules
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize, sent_tokenize

# Split scene_one into sentences: sentences
sentences = sent_tokenize(scene_one)

# Use word_tokenize to tokenize the fourth sentence: tokenized_sent
tokenized_sent = word_tokenize(sentences[3])

# Make a set of unique tokens in the entire scene: unique_tokens
unique_tokens = set(word_tokenize(scene_one))

# Print the unique tokens result
print(unique_tokens)

# More regex with re.search()
# In this exercise, you'll utilize re.search() and re.match() to find specific tokens. Both search and match expect regex patterns, similar to those you defined in an earlier exercise. You'll apply these regex library methods to the same Monty Python text from the nltk corpora.
# You have both scene_one and sentences available from the last exercise; now you can use them with re.search() and re.match() to extract and match more text.
# Search for the first occurrence of "coconuts" in scene_one: match
match = re.search("coconuts", scene_one)

# Print the start and end indexes of match
print(match.start(), match.end())

# Write a regular expression to search for anything in square brackets: pattern1
pattern1 = r"\[.*]"

# Use re.search to find the first text in square brackets
print(re.search(pattern1, scene_one))

# Find the script notation at the beginning of the fourth sentence and print it
pattern2 = r"[\w+.:]+:"
print(re.match(pattern2, sentences[3]))

# Advanced tokenization with NLTK and regex
# Regex with NLTK tokenization
# Twitter is a frequently used source for NLP text and tasks. In this exercise, you'll build a more complex tokenizer for tweets with hashtags and mentions using nltk and regex. The nltk.tokenize.TweetTokenizer class gives you some extra methods and attributes for parsing tweets.

# Here, you're given some example tweets to parse using both TweetTokenizer and regexp_tokenize from the nltk.tokenize module. These example tweets have been pre-loaded into the variable tweets. Feel free to explore it in the IPython Shell!

# Unlike the syntax for the regex library, with nltk_tokenize() you pass the pattern as the second argument.
# Import the necessary modules
from nltk.tokenize import regexp_tokenize
from nltk.tokenize import TweetTokenizer
# Define a regex pattern to find hashtags: pattern1
pattern1 = r"#\w+"
# Use the pattern on the first tweet in the tweets list
hashtags = regexp_tokenize(tweets[0], pattern1)
print(hashtags)

# Import the necessary modules
from nltk.tokenize import regexp_tokenize
from nltk.tokenize import TweetTokenizer
# Write a pattern that matches both mentions (@) and hashtags
pattern2 = r"([@|#]\w+)"
# Use the pattern on the last tweet in the tweets list
mentions_hashtags = regexp_tokenize(tweets[-1], pattern2)
print(mentions_hashtags)

# Import the necessary modules
from nltk.tokenize import regexp_tokenize
from nltk.tokenize import TweetTokenizer
# Use the TweetTokenizer to tokenize all tweets into one list
tknzr = TweetTokenizer()
all_tokens = [tknzr.tokenize(t) for t in tweets]
print(all_tokens)

# Non-ascii tokenization
# In this exercise, you'll practice advanced tokenization by tokenizing some non-ascii based text. You'll be using German with emoji!
# Here, you have access to a string called german_text, which has been printed for you in the Shell. Notice the emoji and the German characters!
# The following modules have been pre-imported from nltk.tokenize: regexp_tokenize and word_tokenize
# Unicode ranges for emoji are:
# ('\U0001F300'-'\U0001F5FF'), ('\U0001F600-\U0001F64F'), ('\U0001F680-\U0001F6FF'), and ('\u2600'-\u26FF-\u2700-\u27BF').
# Tokenize and print all words in german_text
all_words = word_tokenize(german_text)
print(all_words)

# Tokenize and print only capital words
capital_words = r"[A-Z|Ãœ]\w+"
print(regexp_tokenize(german_text, capital_words))

# Tokenize and print only emoji
emoji = "['\U0001F300-\U0001F5FF'|'\U0001F600-\U0001F64F'|'\U0001F680-\U0001F6FF'|'\u2600-\u26FF\u2700-\u27BF']"
print(regexp_tokenize(german_text, emoji))

# Charting word length with NLTK
# Charting practice
# Try using your new skills to find and chart the number of words per line in the script using matplotlib. The Holy Grail script is loaded for you, and you need to use regex to find the words per line.
# Using list comprehensions here will speed up your computations. For example: my_lines = [tokenize(l) for l in lines] will call a function tokenize on each line in the list lines. The new transformed list will be saved in the my_lines variable.
# You have access to the entire script in the variable holy_grail. Go for it!

# Split the script into lines: lines
lines = holy_grail.split('\n')

# Replace all script lines for speaker
pattern = "[A-Z]{2,}(\s)?(#\d)?([A-Z]{2,})?:"
lines = [re.sub(pattern, '', l) for l in lines]

# Tokenize each line: tokenized_lines
tokenized_lines = [regexp_tokenize(s, '\w+') for s in lines]

# Make a frequency list of lengths: line_num_words
line_num_words = [len(t_line) for t_line in tokenized_lines]

# Plot a histogram of the line lengths
plt.hist(line_num_words)

# Show the plot
plt.show()
