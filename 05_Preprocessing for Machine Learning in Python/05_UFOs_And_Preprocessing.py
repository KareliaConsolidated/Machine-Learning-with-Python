# Checking column types
# Take a look at the UFO dataset's column types using the dtypes attribute. Two columns jump out for transformation: the seconds column, which is a numeric column but is being read in as object, and the date column, which can be transformed into the datetime type. That will make our feature engineering efforts easier later on.
# Check the column types
print(ufo.dtypes)

# Change the type of seconds to float
ufo["seconds"] = ufo["seconds"].astype(float)

# Change the date column to type datetime
ufo["date"] = pd.to_datetime(ufo["date"])

# Check the column types
print(ufo[["seconds", "date"]].dtypes)

# Dropping missing data
# Let's remove some of the rows where certain columns have missing values. We're going to look at the length_of_time column, the state column, and the type column. If any of the values in these columns are missing, we're going to drop the rows.
# Check how many values are missing in the length_of_time, state, and type columns
print(ufo[['length_of_time', 'state', 'type']].isnull().sum())

# Keep only rows where length_of_time, state, and type are not null
ufo_no_missing = ufo[ufo['length_of_time'].notnull() & 
          ufo['state'].notnull() & 
          ufo['type'].notnull()]

# Print out the shape of the new dataset
print(ufo_no_missing.shape)
